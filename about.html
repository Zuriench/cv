  <h3>favourite scriptures</h3>

  <p><strong>Galatians 2:16-17, 19-21</strong><br>
    "Yet we know that a man is not justified [and placed in right standing with God] by works of the Law, but [only] through faith in [God’s beloved Son,] Christ Jesus.
    <br>
    And even we [as Jews] have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the Law.
    <br>
    By observing the Law no one will ever be justified [declared free of the guilt of sin and its penalty]."
  <div class="scroll" style="margin-right: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px"><strong>Romans 8:38-39</strong><br>For I am convinced [and continue to be convinced—beyond any doubt] that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things
    present and threatening,
    nor things to come, nor powers,nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the [unlimited] love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord
  </div>
  "But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ [by faith], we ourselves are found to be sinners, does that make Christ an advocate or promoter of our sin? Certainly not!"
  <br>
  "For through the Law I died to the Law and its demands on me [because salvation is provided through the death and resurrection of Christ], so that I might [from now on] live to God."
  <br>
  "I have been crucified with Christ [that is, in Him I have shared His crucifixion]; <span>it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.</span>
  <br>
  The life I now live in the body I live by faith [by adhering to, relying on, and completely trusting] in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
  <br>
  "I do not ignore or nullify the [gracious gift of the] grace of God [His amazing, unmerited favor], for if righteousness comes through [observing] the Law, then Christ died needlessly. [His suffering and death would have had no purpose
  whatsoever.]"

  <br>
  <div style="text-align: center">
    <div class="top-tooltip-with-bottom-arrow">Ecclesiastes 7:1,3,4
      <span class="top-tooltiptext-with-bottom-arrow">
        "A good name is better than precious perfume, And the day of one’s death better than the day of one’s birth.<br><br>
        Sorrow is better than laughter, For when a face is sad (deep in thought) the heart may be happy [because it
        is growing in wisdom].<br><br>
        The heart of the wise [learns when it] is in the house of mourning, But the heart of fools is [senseless] in the house of pleasure."
      </span>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="right-tooltip-with-left-arrow">Ecclesiastes 7:5,8
      <span class="right-tooltiptext-with-left-arrow">
        "It is better to listen to the rebuke of the wise man and pursue wisdom Than for one
        to listen to the song of fools and pursue stupidity.<br><br>
        The end of a matter is better than its beginning; Patience of spirit is better than haughtiness of spirit (pride)."

    <br>
    <div class="bottom-tooltip-with-top-arrow">Ecclesiastes 7:9,12,16
      <span class="bottom-tooltiptext-with-top-arrow">
        "Do not be eager in your heart to be angry, For anger dwells in the heart
        of fools. <br> <br>
        For wisdom is a protection even as money is a protection, But the [excellent] advantage of knowledge is that wisdom shields and preserves the lives of its possessors.<br><br>
        Do not be excessively righteous [like those given to
        self-conceit], and do not be overly wise (pretentious)—why should you bring yourself to ruin?"

        "Wisdom strengthens the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.<br><br>
        Behold, I have found only this [as a reason]: God made man upright and
        uncorrupted, but they [both men and women] have sought out many devices [for evil]"</span>
